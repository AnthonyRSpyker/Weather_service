The first search that was performed was for Denver Colorado.  There is no necesitation for capitalization.  Once the search button is pressed, the area directly adjacent to the search bar will be occupied with the current date and weather information.  As can be seen in the picture above.  Directly below that box there is a five day forcast that is populated as well.

A second search is performed to show that the searches can be performed sequentially on the same page without refreshing.  Underneith the search bar the area is populated with most recent searches.  These searches are saved on the browser so that the information can be acessed when the user comes back to the site.
